Algorithms
==========

This repository contains example Java code based on the online course Algorithms, [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick and offered by Princeton University on Coursera. The online lessons are based on the book Algorithms, 4th Edition, by the same authors. Additional material is also available from the [book's website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). This repository contains also my submissions to the programming assignments. This is a work in progress, see the assessments to know whether the code passes all the tests for correctness, memory, timing and other metrics. 

## Part I
Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.
### Week 1
The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) is in the percolation folder.
### Week 2 
The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php) is in the queues folder.
## Part II
Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
