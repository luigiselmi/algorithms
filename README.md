Algorithms
==========

This repository contains Java code examples based on the online course Algorithms, [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) 
and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick and offered by Princeton University 
on Coursera. The online lessons are based on the book Algorithms, 4th Edition, by the same authors. Additional material is also available from 
the [book's website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). This repository contains also my submissions to the programming assignments. This 
is a work in progress, see the assessments to know whether the code passes all the tests for correctness, memory, timing and other metrics. 
Maven is used to compile and execute the code. The Java files that have been developed as solutions to the assignments are encrypted in order 
to comply with the Coursera Honorâ€™s Code.

## Compile and execute
You can compile and execute the code using Java or Maven.

### Compile and execute with Java
In order to compile the java source files you have first to create a folder that will contain all the compiled classes. You 
can organize the folder as with Maven, with a *target* folder and a *classes* sub-folder. From the project root folder execute

```
$ mkdir -p target/classes 
```
In order to compile the Java code you need the [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) Java library to be added to the classpath. In 
the example the library is in the *lib* folder. Since the Java compiler cannot find recursively all the Java files by itself, you need to add a 
bash *find* command

```
$ javac -cp "lib/algs4.jar" -d target/classes $(find src/main/java -name '*.java')
```

In order to execute a Java class, from the project root folder, you need to add the compiled classes and the algs4.jar library to the classpath. 
As an example the command 

```
$ java -cp "lib/algs4.jar;target/classes" searching.WordCounter < resources/searching/tinyTale.txt
```

executes the *WordCounter* Java class, in the *searching* package, that takes in input a stream from a file (not the file name !) containing 
text and writes, in the standard output, the number of distinct words and the complete words list. 

It can be useful to execute some of the classes that are provided in the algs4.jar library. As an example

```
$ java -cp "lib/algs4.jar" edu.princeton.cs.algs4.FrequencyCounter 8 < resources/searching/tinyTale.txt
```

executes the Java class FrequencyCounter, in the edu.princeton.cs.algs4 package in the algs4.jar library, that takes as an argument the minimum 
length of a word to be counted, a list of words from the input stream fed by a text file, and prints the most frequent word with at least that 
length.     

### Compile and execute using Maven
You can compile all the Java classes using Maven

```
$ mvn compile
```

When the command returns, a new *target* folder is created, as Maven's convention, with a sub-folder *classes* containing all the compiled java 
classes. Examples of how to execute a Java class using Maven are provided in the following sections. 

## Part I
Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. 

### Week 1
The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) is in the 
percolation folder. You can execute the code using Maven

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.percolation.PercolationVisualizer" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/percolation/input20.txt"
```

### Week 2 
The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php) is in the queues 
folder. You can execute the code using Maven

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.queues.Permutation" -Dexec.args="8" < resources/assignments/queues/distinct.txt
```

### Week 3
The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php) is in the 
collinear folder. You can execute the code using Maven

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.collinear.FastCollinearPoints" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/collinear/input8.txt" 
```

### Week 4
The main topics are priority queues and the heap sort algorithm. A Priority queue is a data structure  that provides two
main APIs:

* insert
* remove the maximum

It can be implemented using a stack or a queue but it's more convenient to use a heap-ordered binary tree on top of an array. The heapsort 
algorithm is an optimal sorting algorithm that can be divided in two phases. In the 1st phase the algorithm builds an heap-ordered binary tree 
with the maximum value at its root. In the 2nd phase, the root element is repeatedly exchanged with the last one and removed in order to produce 
a list of ordered elements. A priority queue can be used to implement the A* algorithm and solve the 8-puzzle and the 15-puzzle finding the least 
set of tile moves to reach the goal with all the tiles ordered. The Java code for the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php) 
and solver of the puzzles is in the puzzle folder. As usual you can execute the code using Maven

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.puzzle.Solver" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/puzzle/puzzle04.txt"
```

### Week 5
The topics of week 5 are balanced search trees and their applications. The [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php) 
is about kd-trees and in particular 2d-trees. The Java class KdTreeVisualizer.java computes and draws the 2d-tree that results from the sequence 
of points clicked by the user in the standard drawing window.

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.kdtree.KdTreeVisualizer"
```

The Java class NearestNeighborVisualizer.java reads a sequence of points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and inserts those 
points into a 2d-tree. Then, it performs nearest-neighbor queries on the point corresponding to the location of the mouse in the standard drawing 
window.

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.kdtree.NearestNeighborVisualizer" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/kdtree/circle100.txt"
```

The Java class RangeSearchVisualizer.java reads a sequence of points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and inserts those points 
into a 2d-tree. Then, it performs range searches on the axis-aligned rectangles dragged by the user in the standard drawing window.

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.kdtree.RangeSearchVisualizer" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/kdtree/circle100.txt"
```

### Week 6
This week is about hash tables. There is no programming assignment. 

## Part II
Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms.

### Week 1
This week is about undirected and directed graph (aka digraphs). The [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet/specification.php) 
is about creating a digraph from the **WordNet semantic lexicon** and finding specific paths between the synsets (vertices) and computing the relatedness 
of two nouns. Three Java classes must be implemented for this assignment. The 1st one to be implemented is SAP.java that is used to compute the 
shortest ancestral path between two vertices. You can use SAP.java, with some test files, executing the Java class and entering pair of integers, 
that represent two vertices, from the command line

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.wordnet.SAP" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/wordnet/digraph1.txt"
 ```
 
The 2nd Java class to be implemented is WordNet.java that reads two files. The 1st file contains a set of synsets from WordNet, and the 2nd file 
contains the relationships (hypernyms) between the vertices. You can test the correctness of the implementation by executing its main method.

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.wordnet.WordNet" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/wordnet/synsets.txt resources/assignments/wordnet/hypernyms.txt"
```

Finally the 3rd class, Outcast.java, can be used to measure the semantic distance between words, provided in a file, to return the word that is 
the least related to the other ones, as in the example where outcast5.txt contains the words "horse", "zebra", "cat", "bear", "table", and Outcast 
returns correctly the word "table".

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.wordnet.Outcast" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/wordnet/synsets.txt resources/assignments/wordnet/hypernyms.txt resources/assignments/wordnet/outcast5.txt"
```

### Week 2
This week is about undirected and directed edge-weighted graphs in which a weight, or cost, is associated to each edge. The addition of a weight 
enables the representation of many practical problems where a weight can represent the distance between two vertices or some other parameter. 
The main algorithms discussed are Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree in an edge-weighted undirected graph, 
and the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all the other vertices in a directed edge-weighted graph with 
nonnegative weights. One important class of problems, that can be represented by edge-weighted directed graphs and modeled as shortest-paths 
problems, is job scheduling. The [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seam/specification.php) is about 
**seam-carving**, a content-aware image resizing technique. The code in SeamCarver.java provides the API to find horizontal and vertical seams. A vertical
seam is a path, from the top border of the image to the bottom one, in which each pixel is chosen to have the minimum energy among the adjacent 
pixels. The same applies for horizontal seams that go from the left border of the image to the right one. The Java class can be used by a client 
application such as ResizeDemo. As an example the following command removes 200 vertical seams and 100 horizontal seams from an image of 600x300 
pixels of a chameleon so that the image size will be reduced to 400x200 preserving its main characteristics.   
   
```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.seam.ResizeDemo" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/seam/chameleon.png 200 100"
```

### Week 3
The material of the 3rd week is about network-flow algorithms. These algorithms are of great interest because they can be used to solve optimization
problems in many different contexts, for instance to find the optimal way to distribute oil through a pipeline network from the oil field to a refinery. 
A common network-flow algorithm is the Ford-Fulkerson scheme. It is based on a graph whose edges can have two attributes: a capacity and a flow. The
edge's capacity is a number that specifies the maximum value that can be moved between its vertices, and the flow is the value that is actually used.
The algorithm is also called **maxflow algorithm** because it solves the problem of finding the best way to distribute a flow from a source through a network to a
sink so that the flow is maximal given the capacities of the edges. In order to showcase the applicability of the scheme to many different applications, 
it will be used in the [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/baseball/specification.php) to solve the [baseball elimination problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem#Baseball_elimination).
As an example, the following command finds which team is mathematically eliminated in a baseball division with 5 teams. 

   
```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.baseball.BaseballElimination" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/baseball/teams5.txt"
```   

### Week 4
The first topic of the 4th week is about specialized algorithms for searching in symbol tables with string keys. The difference with symbol tables discussed
in the first part of the course is that the algorithms don't use comparisons for searching and so they can be faster. The 2nd topic is substring search that has 
application in many fields, from search engines to genetics. The [programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/boggle/specification.php) is about
developing an application to find all the valid words composed of random letters displayed on cubes' faces and kept on a board, as in the word game Boggle. The longer the word found
the higher is the score. The main steps are first building the adjacency list of each cube and then searching for words, using letters on adjacent cubes, that are contained in a 
dictionary. The dictionary of valid words can be conveniently stored in a Trie, a symbol table with string keys, while the search can be performed recursively using depth-first search 
on the graph of cubes with their adjacent neighbors. The Boggle solver can be tested using static board and dictionary files as in the example  

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="assignments.boggle.BoggleSolver" -Dexec.args="resources/assignments/boggle/dictionary-algs4.txt resources/assignments/boggle/board4x4.txt"
```

that outputs the valid words that have been found using the letters in the given board with their score

```
AID, score = 1
DIE, score = 1
END, score = 1
ENDS, score = 1
EYE, score = 1
ONE, score = 1
ONES, score = 1
PAID, score = 1
PAINS, score = 2
PAT, score = 1
PATE, score = 1
SEND, score = 1
SIDE, score = 1
SIN, score = 1
SINE, score = 1
SIT, score = 1
SITE, score = 1
TAT, score = 1
TIE, score = 1
TIED, score = 1
TIN, score = 1
TINY, score = 1
TYPE, score = 1
UNIT, score = 1
UNITE, score = 2
UNITED, score = 3
USE, score = 1
YET, score = 1
YOU, score = 1
Number of words found = 29, Score = 33, Timing = 0.039000 (seconds)
```
